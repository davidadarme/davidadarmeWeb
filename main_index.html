            <h1>Dear all,</h1>
            <p>
                Tim's tragic death has deeply affected many people all over the world. He had just begun his journey to get to know and be part of the world outside music. <br><br>Tim was a seeker, a sensitive and a shy person who wanted to know the truth and find ways to an inner peace, he reacted to the injustices of the world and cared deeply about the planet. <br><br>Yet it was in his music that he expressed himself, honestly and openly, and it gave him the most joy... the creative process and collaborations with the people he loved and respected for their art and talent. <br><br>In light of our loss, a loss that is indescribable as parents, but also to Tim's friends, colleagues in the music business and millions of Tim's fans around the world, we felt we should make sure that Tim's legacy is used to help in ways that can hopefully make a difference in some important areas. <br><br>With that in mind, Anki and I decided to start and dedicate ourselves to the Tim Bergling Foundation, which is the best thing we can do to honor our son. <br><br>With love, <br>Klas Bergling & Anki Lidén<br>
